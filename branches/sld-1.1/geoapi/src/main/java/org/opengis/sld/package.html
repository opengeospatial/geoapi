  Allows user-defined symbolization of feature data. The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=1188">OpenGIS&reg; Styled Layer Descriptor</A>
  specification.

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Package {@link org.opengis.layer} describes the appearance of a
  map in terms of <CITE>styled layers</CITE>. A styled layer can be considered as a
  transparent sheet with features symbolized upon it. A map is made up of a number of
  these styled layers put together in a specified order. The styled layers are said to
  be Z-ordered. Users can define more complex or simpler maps by adding or removing
  styled layers.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A styled layer itself represents a particular combination of
  <CITE>layer</CITE> and a <CITE>style</CITE> in which that layer can be symbolized.
  Conceptually, the layer defines a stream of features and the style defines how those
  features are symbolized. This concept is underlined by the fact that there may be multiple
  styles in which a layer can be symbolized.</P>

  <H3>Scale selection</H3>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The {@code MinScaleDenominator} and {@code MaxScaleDenominator} elements of a
  {@link org.opengis.sld.Rule} define the range of map-rendering scales for which the rule should be
  applied. The values used are actually the scale <EM>denominators</EM> relative to a "standardized
  rendering pixel size".</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "standardized rendering pixel size" is defined to be 0.28mm &times; 0.28mm
  (millimeters). Frequently, the true pixel size of the final rendering device is unknown in the web
  environment, and 0.28mm is a common actual size for contemporary video displays. If the map-rendering
  software has information available about the actual pixel size of the final display device, then an
  extra processing step will be needed (if the actual pixel size is different from the standard pixel
  size) to adjust the actual rendering scale to calculate the standard rendering scale, which will then
  be used to compare to the scale range of an SLD {@linkplain org.opengis.sld.Rule rule}. If the actual
  display device has non-square pixels, then a method of "linear equivalence" to square pixels should be
  used to calculate the standard rendering scale.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since it is common to integrate the output of multiple servers into a single displayed
  result in the web-mapping environment, it is important that different map servers have consistent behaviour
  with respect to processing scales, so that all of the independent servers will select or deselect rules at
  the same scales.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To insure consistent behaviour, scales relative to coordinate spaces must be handled
  consistently between map servers. For geographic coordinate systems, which use angular units, the angular
  coverage of a map should be converted to linear units for computation of scale by using the circumference
  of the Earth at the equator and by assuming perfectly square linear units. For linear coordinate systems,
  the size of the coordinate space should be used directly without compensating for distortions in it with
  respect to the shape of the real Earth.</P>
  
  <H3>Feature filtering</H3>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The {@code Filter} and {@code ElseFilter} elements of a {@link org.opengis.sld.Rule}
  allow the selection of features in rules to be controlled by attribute conditions. As discussed in the
  previous section, rule activation may also be controlled by the {@code MinScaleDenominator} and the
  {@code MaxScaleDenominator} elements as well as the map-rendering scale.</P>

  <H3>Symbols</H3>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Embedded inside of {@link org.opengis.sld.Rule}s, which group conditions for styling
  features, are symbols. A symbol describes how a feature is to appear on a map. The symbol
  describes not just the shape that should appear but also such graphical properties as color and opacity.
  A symbol is obtained by specifying one of a small number of different types of symbol and then supplying
  parameters to override its default behaviour. Currently, five types of symbols are defined:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>{@linkplain org.opengis.sld.LineSymbol Line}</LI>
    <LI>{@linkplain org.opengis.sld.PolygonSymbol Polygon}</LI>
    <LI>{@linkplain org.opengis.sld.PointSymbol Point}</LI>
    <LI>{@linkplain org.opengis.sld.TextSymbol Text}</LI>
    <LI>{@linkplain org.opengis.sld.MappedColorSymbol MappedColor}</LI>
