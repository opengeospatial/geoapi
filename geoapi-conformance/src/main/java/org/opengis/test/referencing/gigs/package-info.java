/**
 * Implements the <a href="http://www.iogp.org/Geomatics/#gigs">Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience
 * Software</a> tests.
 *
 * <p><b>Changes compared to GIGS files</b><br>
 * The GIGS <cite>Excel</cite> files have been converted to CSV files, and some values have been
 * edited in order to reflect the current values in latest EPSG database. We also increased the
 * precision of some numerical values when needed in order to meet the GIGS accuracy requirements
 * in test results. The changes are <a href="doc-files/changes.html">documented here</a>.</p>
