/**
 * A PropertySeries applies one or more constraintLists to the base property,
 * each providing a set of values for a single secondary axis.
 *
 * Example:
 * A "radiance spectrum" may be based on "radiance" with a list
 * of "wavelength" intervals specified.
 *
 * The "base" association indicates a conceptual relationship, which may be useful in
 * classification of observation types. The value of a specialised property-type must be
 * described using a scale (units of measure, vocabulary) that could also be used for the
 * base.
 *
 * Example:
 * an application may choose to include observations of "WaterTemperature"
 * when the subject of interest is observations of "Temperature".
