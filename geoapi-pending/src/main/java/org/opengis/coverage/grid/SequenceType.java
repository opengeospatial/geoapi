/**
 * Specifies the order in which attribute value records are assigned to {@linkplain GridPoint grid points}.
 * There are several sequencing rules based on incrementing - or decrementing - grid coordinate values in
 * a simple fashion. More complex space filling curves can also be used. Space filling curves are generated
 * by progressively subdividing a space in a regular way and connecting the elements resulting from each
 * subdivision according to some rule. They can be used to generate a grid, but they can also be used to
 * assign an ordering to the grid points or grid cells in a separately defined grid. They lend themselves
 * more readily than simple incrementing methods to sequencing in grids that have irregular shapes or cells
 * of variable size.
 * <p>
 * In every case, ordering of the grid cells starts by incrementing coordinates along one grid axis.
 * At some point in the process, it begins to increment coordinates along a second grid axis, then a
 * third, and so on until it has progressed in the direction of each of the grid axes. The attribute
 * {@linkplain SequenceRule#getScanDirection scan direction} provides a list of signed axis names
 * that identifies the order in which scanning takes place. The list may include an additional element
 * to support interleaving of feature attribute values.
 * <p>
 * Ordering is continuous if consecutive pairs of grid cells in the sequence are maximally connected.
 * It is semicontinuous if consecutive pairs of grid cells are connected, but less than maximally
 * connected, and discontinuous if consecutive pairs of cells are not connected.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> In the two dimensional case, a cell is connected to the 8 cells with which it
 * shares at least one corner. It is maximally connected to the 4 cells with which it shares an
 * edge and two corners. In the three dimensional case, a cell is maximally connected to those
 * cells with which it shares a face.
