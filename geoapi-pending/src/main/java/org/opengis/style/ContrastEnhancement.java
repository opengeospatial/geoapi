/**
 * <p>The ContrastEnhancement object defines contrast enhancement for a channel of
 * a false-color image or for a color image.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>In the case of a color image, the relative grayscale brightness of a pixel
 * color is used. ?Normalize? means to stretch the contrast so that the
 * dimmest color is stretched to black and the brightest color is stretched to
 * white, with all colors in between stretched out linearly. ?Histogram? means
 * to stretch the contrast based on a histogram of how many colors are at each
 * brightness level on input, with the goal of producing equal number of
 * pixels in the image at each brightness level on output.  This has the
 * effect of revealing many subtle ground features. A ?GammaValue? tells how
 * much to brighten (value greater than 1.0) or dim (value less than 1.0) an
 * image. The default GammaValue is 1.0 (no change). If none of Normalize,
 * Histogram, or GammaValue are selected in a ContrastEnhancement, then no
 * enhancement is performed.
