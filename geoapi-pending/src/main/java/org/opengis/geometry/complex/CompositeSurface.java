/**
 * A {@linkplain Complex complex} with all the geometric properties of a surface. Thus, this
 * composite can be considered as a type of {@linkplain OrientableSurface orientable surface}.
 * Essentially, a composite surface is a collection of oriented surfaces that join in pairs on
 * common boundary curves and which, when considered as a whole, form a single surface.

 * @todo This interface extends (indirectly) both {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Primitive} and
 *       {@link org.opengis.geometry.complex.Complex}. Consequently, there is a clash in the semantics
 *       of some set theoretic operation. Specifically, {@code Primitive.contains(…)}
 *       (returns FALSE for end points) is different from {@code Complex.contains(…)}
 *       (returns TRUE for end points).
