/**
 * Surface with a positive orientation.
 * {@code Surface} is a subclass of {@link Primitive} and is the basis for 2-dimensional
 * geometry. Unorientable surfaces such as the M&ouml;bius band are not allowed. The orientation of
 * a surface chooses an "up" direction through the choice of the upward normal, which, if the
 * surface is not a cycle, is the side of the surface from which the exterior boundary appears
 * counterclockwise. Reversal of the surface orientation reverses the curve orientation of each
 * boundary component, and interchanges the conceptual "up" and "down" direction of the surface.
 * If the surface is the boundary of a solid, the "up" direction is usually outward. For closed
 * surfaces, which have no boundary, the up direction is that of the surface patches, which must
 * be consistent with one another. Its included {@linkplain SurfacePatch surface patches} describe
 * the interior structure of a {@code Surface}.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * other than the restriction on orientability, no other "validity" condition is required for GM_Surface.
