/**
 * Arc of the circle determined by 3 points, starting at the first, passing through the second
 * and terminating at the third. If the 3 points are co-linear, then the arc shall be a 3-point
 * line string, and will not be able to return values for center, radius, start angle and end
 * angle.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * in the model, an  {@code Arc} is a subclass of {@link ArcString},
 * being a trivial arc string consisting of only one arc. This may be counter-intuitive in the
 * sense that subclasses are often thought of as more complex than their superclass (with
 * additional methods and attributes). An {@code Arc} is simpler than a {@linkplain ArcString
 * arc string} in that it has less data, but it is more complex in that it can return geometric
 * information such as "center", "start angle", and "end angle". This additional computational
 * complexity forces the subclassing to be the way it is. In addition the "is type of" semantics
 * works this way and not the other.
 * </div>
 *
 * In its simplest representation, the three points in the {@linkplain #getControlPoints control point}
 * sequence for an {@code Arc} shall consist of, in order, the initial point on the arc, some
 * point on the arc neither at the start or end, and the end point of the {@code Arc}. If
 * additional points are given, then all points must lie on the circle defined by any 3 non-colinear
 * points in the control point array. All points shall lie on the same circle, and shall be given
 * in the {@linkplain #getControlPoints control point} array in the order in which they occur on
 * the arc.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * the use of the term "midPoint" for the center {@linkplain Position position}
 * of the {@linkplain #getControlPoints control point} sequence is not meant to require that
 * the {@linkplain Position position} be the geometric midpoint of the arc. This is the best
 * choice for this {@linkplain Position position} from a computational stability perspective,
 * but it is not absolutely necessary for the mathematics to work.
