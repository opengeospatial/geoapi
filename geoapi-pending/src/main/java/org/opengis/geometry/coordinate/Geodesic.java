/**
 * Two distinct positions joined by a geodesic curve. The control points of a {@code Geodesic}
 * shall all lie on the geodesic between its start point and end point. Between these two points,
 * a geodesic curve defined from the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Ellipsoid ellipsoid} or geoid model
 * used by the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference system} may
 * be used to interpolate other positions. Any other point in the {@link #getControlPoints controlPoint}
