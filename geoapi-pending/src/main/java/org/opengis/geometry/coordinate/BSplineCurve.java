/**
 * A piecewise parametric polynomial or rational curve described
 * in terms of control points and basis functions. If the weights in the knots are equal
 * then it is a polynomial spline. If not, then it is a rational function spline. If
 * the Boolean {@link #isPolynomial} is set to {@code true} then the weights shall all be set to 1.
 * A B-spline curve is a piecewise Bézier curve if it is quasi-uniform except that the
 * interior knots have multiplicity "degree" rather than having multiplicity one. In
 * this subtype the knot spacing shall be 1.0, starting at 0.0. A piecewise Bézier curve
 * that has only two knots, 0.0, and 1.0, each of multiplicity (degree+1), is equivalent
 * to a simple Bézier curve.
