# GeoAPI for python

This Python module offers implementation-neutral interfaces for OGC/ISO standards.
Those interfaces can be implemented by wrappers around libraries, not necessarily
in Python. A wrapper around Java implementations of GeoAPI is provided.


## Installation

If any version of this package has been installed before,
it should be uninstalled first by the `pip uninstall` command.
Uninstallation and installation commands need to be run as administrator, which is done by `sudo`:

```
# Skip next line if GeoAPI has not been previously installed.
sudo pip uninstall geoapi
sudo pip install geoapi-<version>.tar.gz
```
