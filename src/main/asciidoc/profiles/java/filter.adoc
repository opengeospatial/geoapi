=== Filters and Java functions

Java `Stream` provides an efficient way to deliver a potentially large amount of features.
The GeoAPI interfaces for filters and expressions have been designed for working smoothly
with the `java.util.stream` interfaces. In particular:

* The GeoAPI `Expression` interface extends the Java `Function` interface.
  Consequently, expressions can be used with the Java standard `Stream.map(Function)` method.
* The GeoAPI `Filter` interface extends the Java `Predicate` interface.
  Consequently, filters can be used with the Java standard `Stream.filter(Predicate)` method.
* The GeoAPI `SortBy` interface extends the Java `Comparator` interface.
  Consequently, sort order can be used with the Java standard `Stream.sorted(Comparator)` method.

Note that GeoAPI aims for interoperability with streams, but does not mandate their use.
implementations are free to ignore streams.
