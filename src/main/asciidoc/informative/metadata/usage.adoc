==== How to use

The interfaces in the GeoAPI metadata packages are primarily containers of primitive types and other metadata types.
Metadata elements will be encountered in the data types from the referencing packages and the interfaces enable
users to obtain the elements of the data type.
As an example, we want to print a list of all the individuals (ignoring organizations)
for a document starting with a `Citation` element:

[source,java]
----
Citation citation = ...;    // We assume this instance is already available

for (Responsibility rp : citation.getCitedResponsibleParties()) {
    if (rp.getRole() == Role.AUTHOR) {
        for (Party party : rp.getParties()) {
            if (party instanceof Individual) {
                InternationalString author = rp.getName();
                System.out.println(author);
            }
        }
    }
}
----

The remainder of the metadata packages work in similar ways,
where client code must disaggregate an instance to obtain the elements needed.
