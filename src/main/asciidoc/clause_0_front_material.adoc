[big]*i.     Abstract*

The GeoAPI Implementation Standard defines application programming interfaces (API) in some programming languages
(currently {supported-languages}) for geospatial applications.
The API includes a set of types and methods which can be used for the manipulation of geographic information structured
following the specifications adopted by the Technical Committee 211 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
and by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
Those interfaces standardize the informatics contract between the client code,
which manipulates normalized data structures of geographic information based on the published API,
and the library code able both to instantiate and operate on these data structures
according to the rules required by the published API and by the ISO and OGC standards.

This standard complements existing OGC standards by defining language specific layers of normalization.
This standard does not replace the core standards developing the OGC/ISO abstract model but complements those documents
for developers by documenting the mapping of types and methods from the abstract model into some programming languages,
providing standard interfaces in the `org.opengis` or `opengis` namespaces and explaining the use of GeoAPI interfaces.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

There is various libraries for helping developers to process geospatial data from programming languages like {supported-languages}.
But the proliferation of API variations degrade interoperability.
Since each library defines its own Application Programming Interface (API),
the choice of a particular library result in a vendor lock-in situation even with open-source softwares.
For example it is difficult for a Web Map Service (WMS) implementation to replace its map projection engine
if all available engines use incompatible APIs.
Standard API in programmatic language can reduce such vendor lock-in by providing a layer which separates client code,
which call the API, from library code, which implements the API.
This follows a similar pattern to the well known JDBC (in Java language) or ODBC (in C/C++ language) API
which provides standardized interfaces to databases.
Clients can use those APIs without concern for the particular implementation which they will use.

GeoAPI interfaces are derived from OGC/ISO conceptual models described by Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.
The XML schemas are generally not used (except when there is no UML diagrams describing the model)
because they carry XML-specific constraints that do not apply to programming languages.
For example querying the coordinate system associated to a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is a single method call in GeoAPI.
But this single operation would have required more than 50 lines of code if the API was generated
from Geographic Markup Language (GML) schema instead than from the UML diagrams of abstract models.

The interfaces described in this standard follow closely, without introducing new concepts,
from the previously published standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium and the International Organization for Standardization.
