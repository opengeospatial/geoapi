== Geospatial API overview

GeoAPI interfaces formalize the handling of types defined in OGC/ISO abstract specifications.
Whereas the OGC/ISO standards define types, operations and relationships using the general UML notation,
GeoAPI types implement the standards as programming language interfaces or simple classes.
The structure of the GeoAPI library mirrors the packaging and separation of the different ISO and OGC specifications
by grouping different types and functionality in separated {supported-languages} language packages.

The `opengis​.annotation` package provides the annotation system
used to document the origin and obligation level of all methods and types in GeoAPI.
These annotations are available through introspection at runtime for any code which wishes to exploit this information.
The `opengis​.util` package provides some basic types shared by two or more standards.
Most of them are derived from <<ISO19103>>.
The packages in the `opengis​.metadata` namespace cover the types defined in the <<ISO19115-1>> and <<ISO19115-2>>
_Metadata_ specifications, which are data structures describing other data.
They are completed by <<ISO19157>> _Data quality_ for the `quality` sub-package.
The packages in the `opengis​.parameter` and `opengis​.referencing` namespaces
implement the types from the <<ISO19111>> _Referencing by Coordinates_ specification
complemented by the mathematical operator types from the <<OGC01-009>> _Coordinate Transformation Services_.
The packages in the `opengis​.geometry` namespace cover the types defined in the <<ISO19107>> _Spatial Schema_ specification,
although version {edition} of the library only defines the elements from that specification needed by the geo-referencing types.
The `opengis​.feature` package covers the meta-classes defined in the <<ISO19109>> _Rules for application schema_ specification,
completed by the dynamic attributes defined in <<OGC18-075>> _Moving Features_ specification.
The feature package is not needed for dynamic languages like Python.
The `opengis​.filter` package covers the types defined in <<ISO19143>> _Filter encoding_ specification.
