coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum

[.source]
<<ISO19111>>

In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.


[[term_covariant]]
=== covariant type
a type that can be replaced by a more specialized type when the property is overridden in a subclass

NOTE: Some programming languages allow covariant return types in method declarations.


[[term_coverage]]

temporal, or spatiotemporal domain

<<ISO19123>>


[[term_dataset]]
=== dataset
identifiable collection of data

[.source]
<<ISO19115-1>>


[[term_datatype]]
=== datatype
set of distinct values, characterized by properties of those values, and by operations on those values

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>

NOTE: Properties of data type values are ordered or unordered, exact or approximate,
numeric or non-numeric and, if ordered, bounded or unbounded, as described in ISO/IEC 11404.

[example]
The data type `Boolean` with properties `unordered`, `exact` and `non-numeric`,
and with operations `equal`, `not`, `and` and `or`.


[[term_dynamic_attribute]]
=== dynamic attribute
characteristic of a feature in which its value taken from the domain of the feature attribute type varies with time

[.source]
<<OGC19-045>>


[[term_enumeration]]
=== enumeration
data type whose values are named individually in the model

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_feature]]
=== feature
abstraction of a real world phenomena

[.source]
<<ISO19109>>

NOTE: A feature can occur as a type or an instance.
Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.


[[term_feature_attribute]]
=== feature attribute
characteristic of a feature

[.source]
<<ISO19109>>

NOTE: A feature attribute can occur as a type or an instance.
Feature attribute type or feature attribute instance is used when only one is meant.


[[term_feature_operation]]
=== feature operation
operation that every instance of a feature type may perform

[.source]
<<ISO19109>>


[[term_function]]
=== function
rule that associates each element from a domain (source, or domain of the function) to a unique element in another domain (target, co-domain, or range)

[.source]
<<ISO19107>>


[[term_geographic_feature]]
=== geographic feature
representation of real world phenomenon associated with a location relative to the Earth

[.source]
<<ISO19101-2>>


[[term_geometric_object]]
=== geometric object
spatial object representing a geometric set

[.source]
<<ISO19107>>


[[term_identifier]]
=== identifier
linguistically independent sequence of characters capable of uniquely and permanently
identifying that with which it is associated

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_inheritance]]
=== inheritance
mechanism by which more specific entities incorporate structure and behavior defined by more general entities

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_instance]]
=== instance
individual entity

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_interface]]
=== interface
UML classifier that represents a declaration of a set of coherent public UML features and obligations
that together constitute a coherent service

NOTE: An interface specifies a contract;
UML requires that any _instance_ (<<term_instance>>) of a classifier that realizes the interface fulfills that contract.
The obligations associated with an interface are in the form of _constraints_ (<<term_constraint>>)
(such as pre- and post-conditions) or protocol specifications,
which can impose ordering restrictions on interactions through the interface.


[[term_java]]
=== Java
trademark of Oracle used to refer to an object oriented, single inheritance programming language
whose syntax derives from the C programming language and which is defined by the Java Language Specification


[[term_literal_value]]
=== literal value
constant, explicitly specified value

[.source]
<<ISO19143>>

NOTE: This contrasts with a value that is determined by resolving a chain of substitution (e.g. a variable).


[[term_metadata]]
=== metadata
data about data

[.source]
<<ISO19115-1>>


[[term_moving_feature]]
=== moving feature
feature whose location changes over time

NOTE: Its base representation uses a local origin and local coordinate vectors
of a geometric object at a given reference time.

NOTE: The local origin and coordinate vectors establish an engineering coordinate
reference system (ISO 19111), also called a local frame or a local Euclidean coordinate system.


[[term_multiplicity]]
=== multiplicity
UML specification of the valid _cardinalities_ (<<term_cardinality>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>

NOTE: An _instance_ (<<term_instance>>) of a collection specified as having a multiplicity of "1â€¦3"
has at least one value and has not more than three values.


[[term_namespace]]
=== namespace
named element that either owns or imports, or both, a set of named elements that can be identified by name

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_object]]
=== object
individual with a state and relationship to other individuals

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>

NOTE: An object is an _instance_ (<<term_instance>>) of a class.


[[term_package]]
=== package
element that is used to group elements, and provides a _namespace_ (<<term_namespace>>) for the grouped elements

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_primitive_type]]
=== primitive type
predefined _data type_ (<<term_datatype>>) without any substructure

[[term_property]]
=== property
facet or attribute of an object referenced by a name

[.source]
<<ISO19143>>


[[term_python]]
=== Python
an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming


[[term_realization]]

abstraction between two named elements or sets of named elements,
one representing a specification and the other representing an implementation of the latter

[.source]
<<ISO19103>>


[[term_trajectory]]
=== trajectory
path of a moving point described by a one parameter set of points

[.source]
<<ISO19141>>
