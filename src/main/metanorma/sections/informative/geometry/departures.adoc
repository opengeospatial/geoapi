[[geometry_departures]]
==== Departures from ISO 19107

Geometries in GeoAPI differ from the OGC/ISO standards
as described in the following sub-sections.


[[geometry_departures_as_renaming]]
==== Renaming
The parent class of all geometries is called `GM​_Object` in the ISO 19107 standard.
GeoAPI interfaces use the `Geometry` name instead,
as the omission of the `GM_ prefix` would leave a name too similar to Java’s `Object` class.

[[geometry_departures_for_convenience]]
===== Convenience
GeoAPI has moved the `Direct­Position` and `Envelope` types from the coordinate sub-package
where they are defined in the ISO 19107 specification up to the `opengis​.geometry` package
due to their importance and frequency of use.

[[geometry_departures_as_additions]]
===== Efficiency
GeoAPI adds the following shortcut methods in the `Envelope` interface.
They are frequently requested information that implementers can often provide
in a more efficient way than forcing users to compute them from lower and upper corners:
`dimension`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `median` and `span`.
