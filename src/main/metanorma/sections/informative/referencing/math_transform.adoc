==== Math transforms
_From <<OGC01-009>> §12.4.5_

The `Coordinate­Operation` object introduced in previous section provides high-level information
(source and target CRS, domain of validity, positional accuracy, operation parameter values, _etc_).
The actual mathematical work is performed by a separate object obtained by a call to `getMath­Transform()`.
In different `Coordinate­Operation` instances, `Math­Transform` instances do not carry any metadata.
They are a kind of black box which knows nothing about the source and target CRS, the domain or the accuracy
(actually the same `MathTransform` can be used for different pairs of CRS if the mathematical work is the same),
Furthermore, `Math­Transform` may be implemented in a very different way than what `Coordinate­Operation` returns.
In particular, many conceptually different coordinate operations such as unit conversions, axis swapping, _etc._
can be implemented by `Math­Transform` as affine transforms and concatenated for efficiency.
The result may be a `Math­Transform` doing in a single step a calculation
described by `Coordinate­Operation` as a chain of distinct operations.
Having `Math­Transform` separated from `Coordinate­Operation` gives more flexibility to implementers for optimizations.

`MathTransform` has a method taking a `DirectPosition` (the coordinates in the source CRS) in input
and returning a `Direct­Position` (the coordinates in the target CRS) in output.
But `Math­Transform` also provides various methods operating on an arbitrary number of coordinate tuples
packed in arrays of `float` or `double` types. If there are many points to transform,
the methods operating on arrays will generally be much more efficient than methods operating on `Direct­Position`.
The example in <<java_coordinate_operation>> shows in Java how to transform the coordinates of 6 cities.


[[math_transform_derivatives]]
===== Partial derivatives
_From <<OGC01-009>> §12.4.5.6_

`MathTransform` can also provide the derivative of the transform function at a point.
For example, if _P_ is a map projection converting degrees of latitude and longitude (_φ_, _λ_)
into projected coordinates (_x_, _y_) in metres,
then the derivative yields the displacement _V⃗_ in metres if the latitude is increased by 1° north,
and the displacement _U⃗_ in metres if the longitude is increased by 1° east.
These vectors are potentially different for all locations on the map.
The figure below illustrates the vectors evaluated at two locations, P₁ and P₂:

The derivative is the matrix of the non-translating portion of the approximate affine map at the point.
The derivative at a location _P_ can be represented by a Jacobian matrix as below.
The first matrix column gives the _V⃗_ vector
and the second column gives the _U⃗_ vector of <<map_projection_derivative>>,
in that order because this example uses _latitude_, _longitude_ axis order as inputs.

                   [(del y) / (del phi), (del y) / (del lambda)]]

Jacobian matrices can easily be concatenated in a chain of operations.
The Jacobian matrix of the whole chain is the product of the Jacobian matrices of each step.
Another useful property is that for obtaining the Jacobian of the reverse operation _P_⁻¹,
the equations do not need to be derived.
The Jacobian of the forward projection can be computed, then the matrix inverted:
