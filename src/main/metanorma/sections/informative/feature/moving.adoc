==== Moving feature
_From <<OGC18-075>> figure 3_

Features often have an attribute of type `Geometry` (<<ISO19107>>).
A sub-type of `Geometry` is `Trajectory` (<<ISO19141>>).
A feature where the geometry is a trajectory is a moving feature.
In addition of time-dependent positions defined by the trajectory,
a moving feature may also have time-dependent attribute values.
Those attributes are represented by the `Dynamic­Attribute` sub-type.
