==== Departures from ISOÂ 19108

Significant departures of GeoAPI from the ISO 19108 standard are the omission of the
`TM_ReferenceSystem` and `TM_TemporalPosition` interfaces, as described in above tables.
The former interface is replaced by `TemporalCRS`, which has been added to ISO 19111 after the publication of ISO 19108.
As a consequence of this replacement, the `TM_TemporalPosition` interface become similar to `DirectPosition`
and can be replaced by the latter with the following substitutions:

* The `TM_TemporalPosition.frame` association is replaced by `DirectPosition.coordinateReferenceSystem`.
* The `TM_Coordinate.coordinateValue` property is replaced by `DirectPosition.coordinate`.
* The `TM_TemporalPosition.indeterminatePosition` property moved to `TM_Instant`.

The latter change is because `TM_TemporalPosition` is replaced by the temporal objects of the standard library
of the target programming languages, and those standard objects do not have an `indeterminatePosition` property.

Another harmonization is the omission of the `TM_RelativePosition` code list.
That code list is identical to the ISO 19143 `TemporalOperatorName` code list, except for one value.
