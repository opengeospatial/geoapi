==== Units of measurement
_From <<ISO19103>> §C.4_

ISO 19103 represents measurements and their units by two base interfaces:
`Measure` for the result from performing the act of ascertaining the value of a characteristic of some entity,
and `UnitOf­Measure` as a quantity adopted as a standard of measurement for other quantities of the same kind.
These two base interfaces have a parallel set of subtypes.
For example, `Length` as a `Measure` specialization for distances,
accompanied by `UomLength` as a `UnitOf­Measure` specialization for length units.
Likewise `Area` is accompanied with `UomArea`, `Time` is accompanied with `UomTime`, _etc._

GeoAPI does not define any interface for the ISO 19103 `Measure` and `UnitOf­Measure` types
because {supported-languages} already have their own library for units of measurement.
For example, Java has standardized a set of quantity interfaces in the Java Specification Request <<JSR385>>.
When such a language-specific standard exists and provides equivalent functionality to ISO 19103, that external standard is used.
See Java profile (<<uom_jsr>>) or Java example code (<<parameterized_units>>) for more information.
