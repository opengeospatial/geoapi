[[naming]]
==== Naming conventions

The interface and property names defined in OGC/ISO standards may be modified
for compliance with the conventions in use in target programming languages.
The main changes are described below:

[[naming_interfaces]]
===== Interfaces
The two-letter prefixes are dropped.
For example, `"MD_Metadata"` and `"CI_Citation"` interfaces are named `"Metadata"` and `"Citation"` in {supported-languages}.
The camel cases convention (for example `"Coordinate­System­Axis"`) is kept unchanged for interfaces.

[[naming_enumerations]]
===== Code lists and enumerations
The two-letter prefixes are dropped in the same way as for interfaces.
Then if the type name ends with the `"Code"` suffix, that suffix is dropped too in strongly-typed languages like Java.
For example, the ISO 19115 `"MD_Topic­Category­Code"` code list is named `"Topic­Category"` in Java classes.
But the `"Code"` suffix drop is not applied to more dynamic languages like Python,
because the naming convention can be a compensation for the absence of compile-time type checks.

[[naming_properties]]
===== Properties
The name adaptations depend on the target programming language and on the multiplicity.
In Java, accessor methods start with the `"get"` prefix and are followed by their property name in camel cases.
But in Python, no prefix is added and the camel case convention is replaced by the snake case convention
(see the `"coordinateSystem"` example below).
If a property allows more than one value, then the plural form of its noun may be used.
The plural form gives a hint to developers that they may need to use indexes or iterators for accessing elements.
