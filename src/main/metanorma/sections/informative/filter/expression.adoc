==== Expression
_From <<ISO19143>> §7.[3…6]_

An expression is a function that receives a resource (typically a `Feature`) in input
and produces a value (typically a character string, a number or a geometry) in output.
The output is restricted to `Boolean` if the expression is used as an operand of a `Logical­Operator` (<<filter>>).

Expressions extend the mechanism provided by the target platform for defining functions.
For example, in the Java language, `Expression` extends the `java​.util​.function​.Function`
interface (<<java_filter>>).

An expression can be a literal, a reference to the values of a particular property in resources,
or a named procedure (for example arithmetic operations between the results of two sub-expressions).
An expression can have zero or more parameters and generates a single result.
The parameters are themselves in turn expressions, and shall appear in the order in which
they are defined in the `Filter­Capabilities` (<<filter_capabilities>>).

`ValueReference` is an expression whose value is computed by retrieving the value indicated
by a name or a XPath in a resource (typically a property in `Feature` instances),
and `Literal` is an expression whose value is a constant.

Parameters are specified at `Expression` creation time.
For example, an expression computing _x_+1 where _x_ is the value of a `Feature` property
can be created with two parameters:
a `Value­Reference` retrieving the _x_ value for each feature
and a `Literal` whose value is the integer 1.
When `apply(f)` is invoked on that "Add" expression where _f_ is a `Feature` instance,
the "Add" expression invokes in turn `apply(f)` on the two above-cited parameters.
The values computed by those parameters are added, then returned by the "Add" expression.
