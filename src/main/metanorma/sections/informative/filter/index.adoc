=== Filter packages

The GeoAPI filter packages use the `opengis​.filter` namespace
and implement the types defined in the <<ISO19143>> - _Filter encoding_ specification.
GeoAPI ignores the XML encoding aspects and retains only the types defined in UML diagrams.

The two most fundamental types are `Expression` and `Filter`, shown in the next sections.
All expressions are identified by a `Scoped­Name` and all filters are identified by a `Code­List`.
This is an extension to the ISO 19143 specification where only some specific sub-types have these identifications.
This generalization allows, in some cases, to execute generic code without the need to check the filter or expression sub-types.
