[[annotations]]
==== Annotated API

The `opengis​.annotation` package allows GeoAPI to document the UML elements
from the various specification documents used for defining the {supported-languages} constructs.
These annotations encode the source document, stereotype, original name, and obligation level
of the various types, properties and operations published by GeoAPI.
The source document may be completed by a version number when the GeoAPI construct
is based on a different edition of a normative document than the dated references
listed in <<references>>.
GeoAPI defines two annotations in the Java language (not in Python):
`@UML` which is applied on types and properties (fields or methods), and
`@Classifier` which can be applied only on types.
Those annotations are shown in the figure below:

An example in <<UML_introspection>> shows how these annotations are applied in the Java language
and how they are available at runtime by introspection.



[[annotations_departures]]
===== Departures from ISO model

Annotations shown in <<annotations-UML>> are related to the <<ISO19115-1>> Metadata standard in the following way:

* The GeoAPI `Obligation` is the ISO `MD​_Obligation­Code` enumeration
  moved into the annotation package for use with other UML-related types.
* A `forbidden` enumeration value has been added for handling the cases where a property defined
  in a parent interface is inapplicable to a sub-interface ([0…0] multiplicity in abstract models).
* The GeoAPI `Stereotype` enumeration is a copy of the ISO `MD​_Datatype­Code` code list
  retaining only the values relevant to annotation of GeoAPI programming elements.
  This duplication exists because the ISO 19115 standard defines a code list, while Java annotations require enumerations.
