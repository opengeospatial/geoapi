[[conformance_tests]]
== Conformance Class Test Suite

This standard provides several levels of conformance for libraries.
The levels are determined mostly by the capabilities of `referencing` or `feature` packages.
This standard does not define conformance level for the `util` and `metadata` packages
because those interfaces are typically implemented on a case-by-case basis in support of other packages.

All implementations must necessarily provide a fully functional implementation of the
two-dimensional case of the `GeographicCRS` interface for the WGS84 ensemble of reference frames.
"Fully functional" means that the implementation must support all mandatory properties of geographic CRS,
notably `Geodetic­Reference­Frame`, `Ellipsoid`, `Prime­Meridian`, `EllipsoidalCS` and `Coordinate­System­Axis`
together with the "degree" and "metre" units of measurement. Optional properties can be omitted.

[[conformance-A]]
=== Level A: base

include::../tests/class_core.adoc[]


[[conformance-B]]
=== Level B: referencing base

The first level identifies implementations capable of providing coordinate reference systems
of various types (geographic, projected, vertical, temporal, compound…) identified by authority codes.
This standard does not define which CRS types and which authority codes should be supported.
The only requirement is that an implementation of the `Register­Operations` interface shall be provided,
potentially completed by a `CRSAuthority­Factory` for each supported authority.
Implementations at this level are not required to support CRS that are not declared on their list of supported authority codes.

Coordinate operations for (source, target) pairs of CRS may be listed in a database such as the EPSG geodetic dataset.
Implementations at this level are not required to support coordinate operations for (source, target) CRS pairs that are not in their database.


[[conformance-C]]
=== Level C: referencing from components

The second level identifies implementations capable to create coordinate reference systems from their components
(datum, axes, projection parameters…).
Implementations at this level shall be able to create a CRS from a Well-Known Text (WKT) character string,
a GML document or from CRS components provided in a programmatic way.
This generally implies the support of the `CRSFactory`, `CSFactory` and `Datum­Factory` interfaces.

Implementations at this level should be able to create `Coordinate­Operation` instances for arbitrary pairs of source and target CRS.
A database may be used for known pairs of CRS, but implementations should be prepared to handle CRS not defined in the database.
