[.component,class=part]
--
Methods which set the value of an object
shall either succeed or throw an exception such as
`UnsupportedOperationException` if the method is not implemented or if the object is unmodifiable,
`IllegalArgumentException` if the value is illegal in that implementation, or
`IllegalStateException` if some context makes the use of that method illegal.
This list of exception types is not exclusive.

*Example:*
A call to `parameter​.setValue(-10.25)` in Java
may have the first of the following results which is applicable:

* The method is supported and the -10.25 value is valid:
  The setter method returns silently.
* The method is not implemented by the library:
  `Unsupported­Operation­Exception` is thrown.
* Values for that parameter are restricted to positive numbers:
  `Illegal­Argument­Exception` is thrown.
* The `Parameter­Value` instance has been declared unmodifiable:
  `Illegal­State­Exception` or `Unsupported­Operation­Exception` is thrown.
