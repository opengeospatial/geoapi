<h2><a name="General"></a>General</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a name="start">How did the GeoAPI project get started, and what is its history?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>The GeoAPI project emerged from the collaboration of several free software projects and
        from the work on various specifications at the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).</p>

        
<p>You can follow the early, pre-history of GeoAPI by reading the following three posts to the
        DigitalEarth.org website; at this point it had no name, only a goal of bringing together multiple
        Java GIS projects.</p>

        
<ul>
          
<li><a class="externalLink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030509104308/http://digitalearth.org/story/2002/10/10/55046/206">Call for a Geo-Spatial API</a></li>
          
<li><a class="externalLink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030510220525/http://digitalearth.org/story/2002/12/2/195021/503">Java GeoSpatial API Part II</a></li>
          
<li><a class="externalLink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030501122912/http://digitalearth.org/story/2002/12/12/121814/73">Java GeoSpatial API Part III</a></li>
       </ul>

        
<p>As you can see in part III, the OGC had just announced a Geographic Objects initiative
        which intended to define Java interfaces for geographic software. This followed earlier work
        on the OGC Implementation Specification 01-009 <cite>Coordinate Transformation Services</cite>
        which included interfaces defined in the <code>org.opengis</code> namespace ultimately adopted
        by GeoAPI.</p>

        
<p>The GeoAPI project eventually formed to pursue this work. The interfaces defined in the
        OGC specification 01-009 became GeoAPI version 0.1. GeoAPI 1.0 was released with the draft
        of OGC specification 03-064 <cite>GO-1 Application Objects</cite>. In May 2005, the final draft
        of the GO-1 specification, which included GeoAPI interfaces, was accepted as an OGC standard
        and the matching version of GeoAPI was released as version 2.0.</p>

        
<p>The GeoAPI 3.0 working group of the OGC has formed in January 2009 to formalized and continue
        the work of standardizing the most stable interfaces produced by the GeoAPI project. The GeoAPI
        specification produced by this group became an OGC standard in April 2011.</p>
      <hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="OGC">What is the relationship between GeoAPI and OGC?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>GeoAPI is closely tied to the OGC both in its origins and in its ongoing work.</p>

        
<p>The GeoAPI project is a collaboration of participants from various institutions and
        software communities. The GeoAPI project is developing a set of interfaces in programming
        languages to help software projects produce high quality geospatial software. The core
        interfaces follow closely the specifications produced in the 19100 series of the
        International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by the OGC. The interfaces use the
        <code>org.opengis</code> namespace and copyright to the code is assigned to the OGC. The
        project started with the code produced by the OGC Implementation Specification 01-009
        <cite>Coordinate Transformation Services</cite> and refactored this code in collaboration
        with the standardization work surrounding the OGC specification 03-064
        <cite>GO-1 Application Objects</cite>.</p>

        
<p>The GeoAPI working group of the OGC is a separate effort made up principally of members
        of the OGC and formed to continue the work of formalizing the interfaces developed by the
        GeoAPI project as ratified standards of the OGC. The working group decided to start the
        <cite>GeoAPI Implementation Specification</cite> as a new standard focused exclusively on the
        interfaces produced by the GeoAPI project. In acknowledgment to the earlier work and to
        match the numbering scheme of GeoAPI, the first specification released under this name
        carry the 3.0 version number.</p>
      <hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="why">Why a standardized set of programming interfaces? Shouldn't OGC standards stick to web services only?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>We believe that both approaches are complementary. Web services are efficient ways to publish geographic
        information using existing software. But some users need to build their own solution, for example a numerical model.
        Many existing software packages provide sophisticated developer toolkits, but each toolkit has its own learning curve,
        and one can not easily switch from one toolkit to another or mix components from different toolkits.
        Using standardized interfaces, a significant part of the API can stay constant across different toolkits,
        thus reducing both the learning curve (especially since the interfaces are derived from published abstract UML)
        and the inter-operability pain points.</p>

        
<p>The situation is quite similar to JDBC (<cite>Java DataBase Connectivity</cite>)'s one. The fact that a high-level
        language already exists for database queries (SQL) doesn't means that low-level programming interfaces are not needed.
        JDBC interfaces have been created as a developer tools in complement to SQL, and they proven to be quite useful.</p>

        
<p>Web services and standard data formats are useful for transferring data to the scientist who processes them.
        But this approach become unpracticable with the very large amount of Earth Observation data.
        Instead, there is a need to do the opposite way: transfer the algorithm to the data in a cloud environment.
        In a situation where both the data and the user (the algorithm) are on the cloud,
        web services and standard data formats may not apply anymore at processing time
        (they are still relevant for fetching the processing results however).
        Instead, cloud environments like Google Earth Engine or Amazon Lambdas allow execution of user-defined algorithms
        in Python, Java or other programming languages, where no data transfer happens from user's perspective
        (whether data transfers happen under the hood when some commands are executed is implementation details).
        But those environments are currently defining their own APIs, at the risk of vendor-lockin.
        Defining a standard API suitable for cloud environments is part of GeoAPI goals.</p>
      <hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="implementation">With standardization of interfaces, aren't you forcing a particular implementation?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>We try to carefully avoid implementation-specific API. Again, JDBC is a good example of what we try to achieve.
        JDBC is an example of successful interfaces-only specification implemented by many vendors.
        Four categories of JDBC drivers exists (pure Java, wrappers around native code, etc.).
        Implementations exist for Access, Derby, HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and many others.</p>

        
<p>The implementation flexibility is demonstrated by the GeoAPI-Proj.4 wrappers.
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://proj.osgeo.org/">Proj.4</a> is an open source C/C++ library performing map projections.
        The Proj.4 API is totally different to GeoAPI. Despite the major design differences and the different
        programming language, the <code><a href="geoapi-proj4/index.html">geoapi-proj4</a></code> module
        successfully provides a <em>view</em> over Proj.4 functionalities through GeoAPI interfaces.</p>

        
<p>It is important to stress out that GeoAPI is all about interfaces. Concrete classes must implement all methods
        declared in their interfaces, but those interfaces don't put any constraint on the class hierarchy. For example
        GeoAPI provides a <code>MathTransform2D</code> interface which extends <code>MathTransform</code>. In no way do
        implementation classes need to follow the same hierarchy. Actually, in the particular case of <code>MathTransforms</code>,
        they usually don't! A class implementing <code>MathTransform2D</code> doesn't need to extend a class implementing
        <code>MathTransform</code>. The only constraint is to implement all methods declared in the <code>MathTransform2D</code>
        interface and its parent interfaces.</p>
      <hr /></dd>
<dt><a name="departures">Why GeoAPI has some departures from ISO specifications? Shouldn't GeoAPI be strictly ISO-compliant?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>The ISO 19103, 19111 and 19115 specifications define mostly <cite>data structures</cite> convertible
        to XML or database schemas. Indeed, the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.epsg.org">EPSG</a> database schema follows
        closely the ISO 19111 structures. However those ISO specifications define few operations. For example
        ISO 19111 provides data structures for describing accurately <cite>Coordinate Reference System</cite>
        objects, but does not said much about how to get instances of them (except from a geodetic dataset).
        In terms of programming languages, the above-cited ISO specifications define mostly no-argument getter methods.
        Few methods performing calculation based on parameter values are specified.</p>

        
<p>Since GeoAPI targets programming languages rather than data formats,
        we provide some more methods performing operations from programmatic parameters.
        Rather than inventing our own, we fetch those methods from other OGC specifications -
        including <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/retired">retired specifications</a> -
        as much as possible. Those methods are documented in various places:</p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>In the &quot;<cite>Comparison with legacy OGC specifications</cite>&quot; annex in the
          <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geoapi">GeoAPI specification</a>.</li>
          
<li>In the list of <a href="snapshot/javadoc/departures.html">departures from the ISO/OGC specifications</a>
          (also an annex in the GeoAPI specification).</li>
          
<li>In source code, class files and javadoc using the <a href="snapshot/javadoc/org/opengis/annotation/UML.html">UML annotation</a>
          associated with the <a href="snapshot/javadoc/org/opengis/annotation/Specification.html#OGC_01009">OGC 01-009 specification enum</a>
          or an other OGC enum.</li>
       </ul>
        
<p>GeoAPI defines also a few convenience methods for frequently used operations
        (for example fetching the Coordinate Reference System of an Envelope)
        and methods for inter-operability with the standard library.
        Those methods are also documented in the departures page.
        Another reason is to adapt to constraints of target programming language
        (e.g. Java has no direct equivalent for the C/C++ <code>enum</code> construct).</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="scripts">Why don't you translate all OGC's UML into programmatic interfaces using some automatic script?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>We tried that path at the beginning of GeoAPI project, and abandoned it.
        Automatic scripts provide useful starting points, but their output do not alway match the expectations of developers.
        For example a popular approach is to generate Java classes
        from the <a class="externalLink" href="http://schemas.opengis.net">XML schemas</a> using JAXB-related technologies.
        Unfortunately the XML schemas defined by ISO 19139 are quite unusual, introducing a lot of redundant elements
        (e.g. <code>citation</code> property values wrapped in <code>CI_Citation</code> XML elements,
        and so on for all other properties).
        API generated from those schemas are twice bigger than the conceptual model.</p>

        
<p>We could derive the API from the UML in <cite>Rational Rose</cite> format instead than the XML schemas,
        but a lot of human intervention is still essential.
        The relationship between UML and programmatic interfaces is not always straightforward.
        For example:</p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
<p>Structures of type <code>union</code> are expressed in Java either by rearranging the
          interface hierarchy, by interface multi-inheritance or by omitting the data structure,
          on a case-by-case basis.</p></li>

          
<li>
<p>Resolution of some specification overlapping require human reading. For example
          ISO 19111:2007 section 3 specifies &quot;<cite>in this international standard, normative
          reference to ISO 19115 excludes the <code>MD_CRS</code> class and its components classes</cite>&quot;
          in order to avoid duplication. An automatic script would not have done this exclusion.</p></li>

          
<li>
<p>Some complexity introduced by historical standardization processes can be avoided. For
          example ISO 19115-2 defines imagery metadata which were not ready in time for the ISO 19115
          schedule. Since new attributes could not be added to the existing ISO 19115 classes, they were
          added in ISO 19115-2 sub-classes of the same name (e.g. <code>MI_Band extends MD_Band</code>).
          GeoAPI merges those &quot;geological layers&quot;.</p></li>

          
<li>
<p>Some additional interfaces or methods were introduced (see <a href="#departures">Why
          GeoAPI has some departures from ISO specifications?</a>).</p></li>
       </ul>

        
<p>The changes applied by human intervention is documented in the
        <a href="snapshot/javadoc/departures.html">departures</a> page.

<dt><a name="collections">Why do you favor Collections over arrays as a return type?</a></dt>
<dd>
        
<p>For performance, more orthogonal API and more freedom on the implementer side.</p>

        
<p><b>Performance (including memory usage)</b></p>
<blockquote>
        
<p>Some robust implementations will want to protect their internal state against uncontrolled changes.
        In such implementations, getter methods need to make defensive copies of their mutable attributes
        (see <a class="externalLink" href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/chapters.html">Effective Java</a>).
        Since arrays are mutable objects, robust implementations would need to clone their arrays
        before to return them; otherwise nothing prevent a user from writing the following:</p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>pointArray.positions()[1000] = null</pre></div>

        
<p>and thus altering the <code>PointArray</code> state if <code>positions()</code> was returning a direct reference
        to its internal array. On the other side, collections can be read-only views over internal arrays, thus avoiding
        the need to clone their data in getter methods.</p></blockquote>

        
<p><b>More orthogonal API</b></p>
<blockquote>
        
<p>If a geometry is mutable (at implementer choice), an user may whish to add, edit or remove elements. With arrays
        as return types, we would need to add some <code>add(...)</code> and <code>remove(...)</code> methods in most
        interfaces. Using collections, such API weight is not needed since the user can write the following idiom:</p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>pointArray.positions().add(someNewPosition);</pre></div>

        
<p>The <code>PointArray</code> behavior in such case is left to implementers. It may throw an
        <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>, keep the point in memory, stores its coordinates immediately in a
        database, <cite>etc.</cite></p>

        
<p>In addition of keeping the API lighter, collections as return types also give us for free many additional
        methods like <code>contains(...)</code>, <code>addAll(...)</code>, <code>removeAll(...)</code>, <cite>etc.</cite>
        Adding those kind of methods directly into the geometry interfaces would basically transforms geometries into
        new kind of collections and duplicates the collection framework work without its &quot;well accepted standard&quot;
        characteristic.</p></blockquote>

        
<p><b>More freedom on implementer side</b></p>
        
<blockquote>
<ul>
          
<li>Collections are more abstract than arrays:
          
<ul>
            
<li>In the Java language, a collection can be a view over an array (<code>using Arrays.asList(...)</code>
            for example). The converse is impossible in the general case (<code>Collection.toArray()</code> doesn't
            create a view; it usually copies the array).</li>

            
<li>In the .NET language, an array is a collection but a collection is not always an array. onversions
            from an arbitrary collection to an array may require a copy, like in Java.</li>
         </ul></li>

          
<li>A collection can be read-only or not, at implementer choice. Java arrays are always mutable and
          need defensive copies (not to be confused with defensive copies of array or collection <em>elements</em>).</li>

          
<li>Collections allow one more degree of freedom for deferred execution or lazy data loading. Object
          creations can occur on a per-element basis in collection getter methods. In an array, the reference to
          all elements must be initialized before the array is returned.</li>
       </ul></blockquote>
