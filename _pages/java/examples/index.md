<h1>GeoAPI examples in Java</h1>

<p>
  There is 3 categories of examples, depending on target audience:
</p>

<ul class="verbose">
  <li>
    <a href="usage.html">Using GeoAPI</a> with third-party implementations.
    Users must select an implementation before to execute code.
    Some implementations are listed for making easier to run the examples,
    but that list does not aim to be exhaustive and
    is not an <abbr>OGC</abbr> endorsement of those implementations.
  </li><li>
    <a href="implement.html">Implementing GeoAPI</a> with simple classes in the public domain,
    which implementers can use as a starting point for their own products.
  </li><li>
    <a href="testing.html">Testing an implementation</a> with the
    <a href="../../conformance/index.html">conformance tests</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Wrappers to existing libraries</h2>

<p>
  The following wrappers are provided as "proof of concept" implementations of GeoAPI.
  They are not committed deliverable of GeoAPI project and may change or be removed at any time.
  Developers interested in those wrappers are encouraged to copy this code (if useful) in new projects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="gdal/index.html">GDAL wrapper</a> using Java and Python bindings to the GDAL library.</li>
  <li><a href="netcdf/index.html">NetCDF wrapper</a> in Java for the <abbr>UCAR</abbr> netCDF library.</li>
  <li><a href="proj4/index.html">Proj.4 wrapper</a> in Java for version 4 of the PROJ library.</li>
