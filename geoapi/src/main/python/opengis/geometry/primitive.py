      the horizon). above the horizontal, negative below the horizon),
      essentially by creating a spherical spherical coordinate system;

    - a directional vector derived from the coordinate system at the
      initial point, a unit vector with the direction associated with
      the set of angles.

    Since the two types of measurement are identical, the azimuth values
    are the same, but the interpretations will depend on the usage (usually
    a reference direction, the offset “0”). will depend on usage (usually a
    reference direction, offset “0”, and a direction of rotation, clockwise).

    The value of the Bearing data type can only be valid at the point from
    which the measurement is taken. The common “parallel” transformation of
    vectors from one point to another is only valid if the
    `GeometricReferenceSurface` used is planar (i.e. Cartesian and, therefore,
    Euclidean). The fundamental problem is that the sphere has no universally
    valid 2D world coordinate system for its tangent spaces. Using a fixed
    direction reference such as “true north” does allow some translation,
    however, if the reference exists and is unique at a given position.
    For example, north does not exist at the North Pole and is not unique at
    the South Pole.

    Azimuths can be measured in both directions, as absolute values (such as
    true north, see azimuth) or relative (such as “before” or “after”).
