 * A literal or a named procedure that performs a distinct computation.
 * An expression can accept zero or more arguments as input and generates a single result.
 * The arguments themselves are in-turn expressions and shall appear in the order in which
 * they are defined in the {@code FilterCapabilities}.
 *
 * <p>Expressions are applied on objects of type {@code <R>}.
 * Those objects are typically {@link Feature} instances,
 * but expressions can also be used with other kind of objects such as coverage's geometry-value pairs.
 * The value of {@code <? super R>} can be obtained at runtime by a call to {@link #getResourceClass()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Expressions return a value of type {@code <V>}.
 * Expressions that can be used as {@link Filter} operators shall return a {@link Boolean} result.</p>
 *
 * <p>Expressions can be implementation-specific functions.
 * Each execution environment should provide a list of supported functions
 * (and the number of arguments they expect) in their {@code FilterCapabilities}.</p>

     *
     * <h4>Use case</h4>
     * This method is useful when a client needs to narrow the type of values provided by an expression.
     * For example, a method doing spatial operations may accept only expressions returning geometry objects.
     * A call to {@code expression.toValueType(Geometry.class)} gives a chance to detect early if an expression
     * is not suitable to spatial operations.
     *
     * <h4>Exceptions</h4>
     * An {@link ClassCastException} should be thrown at this method invocation time if values are known to be
     * unconvertible to the specified type. But if convertibility can only be determined at {@link #apply(R)}
     * invocation time, then a {@link ClassCastException} can be thrown at evaluation time.
     * In this paragraph, "convertible" does not necessarily mean that implementations must be able to copy values
     * into objects of specified type. It is okay to apply only {@linkplain Class#cast(Object) standard Java casts}.
     *
     * @param  <N>     compile-time value of {@code target} type.
     * @param  target  desired type of expression results.
     * @return expression doing the same operation this this expression but with results of the specified type.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the specified type is not a target type supported by implementation.
