/**
 * Base interface for all factories. Factories can be grouped in two categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.AuthorityFactory Authority factories}
 *       creates objects from a compact string defined by an authority.</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.ObjectFactory Object factories}
 *       allows applications to make objects that cannot be created by an authority
 *       factory.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Object factories are very flexible, whereas the authority factories are easier to use.
 *
 * @departure harmonization
 *   This interface is not part of the OGC specification. It is added for uniformity,
 *   in order to provide a common base class for all factories.
