/**
 * Declaration of the types of objects created by a factory.
 * For a given class <var>T</var> of objects, whether a factory of class <var>F</var>
 * may be able to create instances of <var>T</var> can be tested with the following code:
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 * for (Class<?> p : F.getAnnotation(Produces.class).value()) {
 *     if (p.isAssignableFrom(T)) {
 *         return true;
 *     }
 * }
 * return false;
 * }
 *
 * This annotation does not need to list all subtypes.
 * A parent type can be declared if the annotated factory is the only one to produce the subtypes.
 * For example, {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CRSAuthorityFactory} declares that it produces
 * instances of {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} without enumerating
 * all <abbr>CRS</abbr> subtypes, because no other GeoAPI factory produce <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 *
 * <h2>Why not in public API</h2>
 * This annotation is helpful for {@link org.opengis.referencing.RegisterOperations} default methods,
 * but there is no evidence yet that it would be more generally useful. Furthermore, the use of base
 * types instead of enumerating all types assumes a closed world, where all annotated factories are
 * known in advance. If this annotation was made public, we would need to explain that it is only for
 * GeoAPI factories, and we would need to add the annotation on all factories (it is currently applied
 * only on authority factories).
