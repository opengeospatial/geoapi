 * Degree to which the sample used has produced a result which is representation of the data.
 * A statistical method based on sampling could be considered as reliable as a global method
 * when all the geographic zones and concerned time periods are covered and the population
 * is sufficiently large. It is not only the size of the sample which is crucial but also
 * how well it represents the actual state of the data.
