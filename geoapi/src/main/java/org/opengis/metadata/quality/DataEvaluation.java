/**
 * Data evaluation method.
 * Data quality evaluation methods can be divided into two main classes: direct and indirect.
 * Direct evaluation methods determine data quality through the comparison of the data with reference information.
 * Indirect evaluation methods infer or estimate data quality using information on the data such as lineage.
 * Direct evaluation methods should be used in preference to indirect evaluations.
