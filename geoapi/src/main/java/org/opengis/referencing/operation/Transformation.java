/**
 * An operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of Datum. The parameters
 * of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates
 * of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process
 * is usually "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates
 * for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result
 * in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation.
