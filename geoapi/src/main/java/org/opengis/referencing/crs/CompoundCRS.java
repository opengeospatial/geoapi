/**
 * A <abbr>CRS</abbr> describing the position of points through two or more independent <abbr>CRS</abbr>s.
 * Two <abbr>CRS</abbr>s are independent of each other if coordinate values in one cannot be converted or
 * transformed into coordinate values in the other.
 *
 * <p>For spatial coordinates, a number of constraints exist for the construction of compound <abbr>CRS</abbr>s.
 * For example, the <abbr>CRS</abbr>s that are combined should not contain any duplicate or redundant axes.
 * Valid combinations include (non-exhaustive list):</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Geographic 2D + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Geographic 2D + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</li>
 *   <li>Projected 2D  + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Projected 2D  + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</li>
 *   <li>Engineering (horizontal 2D) + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Engineering (1D linear) + Vertical</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Any coordinate reference system (<abbr>CRS</abbr>), or any of the above listed combinations of <abbr>CRS</abbr>s,
 * can have a {@link TemporalCRS} added. More than one temporal <abbr>CRS</abbr> may be added if these axes represent
 * different time quantities.

     * A four dimensional compound <abbr>CRS</abbr>s can be made of three single <abbr>CRS</abbr>s:

     * best transformation in a registry.
