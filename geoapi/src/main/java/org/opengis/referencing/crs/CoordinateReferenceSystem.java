/**
 * Base type of all Coordinate Reference Systems (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).
 * This is the base interface for two cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link SingleCRS}, defined by a
 *       {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate system} and a
 *       {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datum} or datum ensemble;</li>
 *   <li>{@link CompoundCRS}, defined as a sequence of {@code SingleCRS}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * A coordinate reference system (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) captures the choice of values
 * for the parameters that constitute the degrees of freedom of the coordinate space.
 * The fact that such a choice has to be made, either arbitrarily or by adopting values from survey measurements,
 * leads to the large number of coordinate reference systems in use around the world.
 * It is also the cause of the little understood fact that the latitude and longitude of a point are not unique.
 * Without the full specification of the coordinate reference system,
 * coordinates are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst.
 *
 * <h2>Spatiotemporal <abbr>CRS</abbr></h2>
 * The concept of coordinates may be expanded from a strictly spatial context to include time.
 * Time is then added as another coordinate to the coordinate tuple. It is even possible to add
 * two time-coordinates, provided the two coordinates describe different independent quantities.
 * An example of the latter is the time/space position of a subsurface point of which the vertical
 * coordinate is expressed as the two-way travel time of a sound signal in milliseconds, as is
 * common in seismic imaging. A second time-coordinate indicates the time of observation.

     *   ISO 19111 defines this method for {@link SingleCRS} only. GeoAPI declares this method in this parent interface
     *   for user convenience, because <abbr>CRS</abbr> dimension and axes are commonly requested information and are
     *   always available, directly or indirectly, even for {@link CompoundCRS}.
